# Workflows created on WINGS workflow system for the Hydrology domain

This is the structure of the repository:

- TACC folder contains the domain that you should import into WINGS to be able to use the workflows. But first you must create a zip file from this folder before importing this file. You can find more info about [how to manage domains on WINGS in the tutorial](http://www.wings-workflows.org/tutorial/manage_domain).

I decompressed the TACC.zip file created when exporting/downloading a domain using the WINGS portal because it is easier to use git to track the version of the files separated instead of a zip file, and also because Github complains about files larger than 100 MB.

- Images folder contains the workflow sketches in PNG format from the TACC domain that you can use in presentations. I will try to keep this folder updated with the newest version of each workflow. Each file corresponds to a workflow in the domain.
